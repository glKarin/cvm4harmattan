# Do not rename the following classes because their names are
# checked during security subsystem initialization

# These packages are restricted
# Non-romized code cannot load new classes into them

# Quick native functions are smaller in ROM footprint and are faster to invoke.
# Do not use quick native for Java native function calls that have
